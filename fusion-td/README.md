# Fusion TouchDesigner Project

## Project Overview

In just a week of using TouchDesigner, I realized the sheer amount of possibilities this app offers. I’d be insulting those who mastered it before me if I delivered a masterpiece on my first try, but nonetheless, this is my experience in an attempt to create something not only presentable, but also pretty damn sick! Using a mix of my programming knowledge, the tutorials mentioned here, and some other assets from the internet, I composed these effects hoping they’ll satisfy the masses. I’ve never done anything like this before, so this was both a great opportunity and a wonderful experience.


## Effects

### Effect 1: Audio-Reactive Animation

Followed a tutorial to get the base effect, then customized it with better parameters and tighter audio response for the festival setup.

### Effect 2: Vectorscope Visualizer

Found this during research, adapted it for live audio, and integrated it into the scene manager. Clean, reactive, and adds a sharp edge.

### Effect 3: OIIA OIIA Cat Effect with Custom Lighting

The most work by far. Combined the OIIA cat with a background effect and built a custom lighting system from scratch to make it shine.

### Effect 4: Analog Wave Buildup Visualizer

Pulled this from an online concept and made it work with our setup. Delivers smooth, analog-style wave buildups that hit perfectly with the audio

## Technical Implementation

All effects were modified to work with live audio input for the festival environment, with careful attention to performance optimization. The scene manager I created enables smooth transitions between effects and provides centralized control for the installation.
