# Fusion TD Project

## Project Overview

This project consists of four audio-reactive visual effects created in TouchDesigner for a festival installation. All effects were configured to work primarily with live audio input, with audio files as a fallback option. The project includes a custom scene manager to control transitions between the different visual experiences.

## My Contributions

- Created and fine-tuned 4 distinct audio-reactive visual effects
- Built a scene manager to coordinate transitions between effects
- Implemented live audio reactivity across all effects
- Configured and optimized the entire system for festival performance
- Combined multiple effect techniques to create unique visuals

## Effects

### Effect 1: Audio-Reactive Animation

A dynamic interactive animation that responds to audio input. I followed a tutorial to build the initial effect, then extended and fine-tuned it specifically for the festival environment with custom parameters and improved reactivity.

### Effect 2: Vectorscope Visualizer

An impressive vectorscope-based visualization effect discovered through research and implemented into this project. I adapted the core concept to work seamlessly with our live audio setup and integrated it into the scene management system.

### Effect 3: OIIA OIIA Cat Effect with Custom Lighting

The most time-intensive effect in the project. I implemented the popular "OIIA OIIA cat" visual on top of a background effect, but needed to create a custom lighting system from scratch. This effect required significant improvisation and custom development to achieve the desired result.

### Effect 4: Analog Wave Buildup Visualizer

A sophisticated audio visualization effect that creates analog-style wave buildups in response to audio. I discovered this effect during research and integrated it into our project, configuring it to respond optimally to live audio input.

## Technical Implementation

All effects were modified to work with live audio input for the festival environment, with careful attention to performance optimization. The scene manager I created enables smooth transitions between effects and provides centralized control for the installation.
